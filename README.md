‚ú® Explore BPMN orchestration of a microservice architecture ‚ú®

 - zeebe as `bpmn` engine
 - define a `zeebe-kafka-worker` allowing integration between kafka broker and the engine

## Requirements
 - `docker` + `docker-compose` installed
 - `node` installed
 - A [dns proxy](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif) installed, routing `**.local` hosts to `localhost`

## Setup
Install all needed dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Build all needed docker images:
```
npx nx run-many --target=docker-build --all=true
```

Spin up environment:
```
docker-compose up
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [nginxproxy/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/nginx-proxy) is used as ingress controller. `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `VIRTUAL_PORT` env variables on services are used ad host-based routing.

Open http://zeebe-play.local/view/deployment in your preferred browser.

Deploy the sample bpmn process `/bpmn/test.bpmn`

Open the loaded process definition and run an instance with following parameters:
```json
{
  "kafka.publishTopic": "REQ_TOPIC",
  "kafka.receiveTopic": "RES_TOPIC",
  "kafka.message": { "payload": { "name": "luke" } }
}
```

See the orchestrated microservice been called and execute the work:
```
docker-compose logs -f booking-api
```
